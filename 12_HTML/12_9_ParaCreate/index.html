        There is a language 'little known,'<br />
        Lovers claim it as their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its symbols smile upon the land, <br />
        Wrought by nature's wondrous hand;
      </p>
      <p>
        And in their silent beauty speak,<br />
        Of life and joy, to those who seek.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Love Divine and sunny hours <br />
        In the language of the flowers.
